@article{Subbiah2009,
abstract = {In this contribution, we discuss an extension of the earlier work on scheduling using reachability analysis of timed automata (TA) models, specifically addressing the problem of tardiness minimization. In the TA-based approach the resources, recipes and additional timing constraints are modeled independently as sets of priced timed automata. The sets of individual automata are synchronized by means of synchronization labels and are composed by parallel composition to form a global automaton. The global automaton has an initial location where no operations have been started and at least one target location where all operations that are required to produce the demanded quantities of end-products within the specified due dates have been finished. A cost-optimal symbolic reachability analysis is performed on the composed automaton to derive schedules with the objective of minimizing tardiness. The model formulation is extended to include release dates of the raw materials and due dates of the production orders. The meeting of due dates is modeled by causing additional costs (e.g. penalties for late delivery and storage costs for early production). The modeling approach and the performance of the approach are tested for two different case studies and the results are compared with that of a MILP formulation solved using the standard solver CPLEX. The numerical experiments demonstrate, that the TA-based approach is competitive compared to standard commercial solvers and good feasible solutions are obtained with considerably reduced computational effort.},

@article{Mendez2006,
abstract = {There has been significant progress in the area of short-term scheduling of batch processes, including the solution of industrial-sized problems, in the last 20 years. The main goal of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art in this challenging area. Main features, strengths and limitations of existing modeling and optimization techniques as well as other available major solution methods are examined through this paper. We first present a general classification for scheduling problems of batch processes as well as for the corresponding optimization models. Subsequently, the modeling of representative optimization approaches for the different problem types are introduced in detail, focusing on both discrete and continuous time models. A comparison of effectiveness and efficiency of these models is given for two benchmarking examples from the literature. We also discuss two real-world applications of scheduling problems that cannot be readily accommodated using existing methods. For the sake of completeness, other alternative solution methods applied in the field of scheduling are also reviewed, followed by a discussion related to solving large-scale problems through rigorous optimization approaches. Finally, we list available academic and commercial software, and briefly address the issue of rescheduling capabilities of the various optimization approaches as well as important extensions that go beyond short-term batch scheduling.},

A novel graph representation that looks at the specific characteristics of production scheduling in chemical processes is proposed. In these graphs, the nodes represent the production tasks, the arcs of the precedence relationships among them. The representation is flexible enough to consider a wide variety of production structures, including complex recipes. Both nonintermediate storage (NIS) and unlimited intermediate storage (UIS) transfer policies can be considered simply by choosing the appropriate precedence relationships. This representation provides the opportunity of incorporating highly efficient graph algorithms together with an appropriate branch-and-bound algorithm for solving multipurpose scheduling problems. The efficiency of the proposed method is established by solving examples and a complex case study.},

@article{Ghaeli2005,
abstract = {Effective scheduling of operations in batch plants has a great potential for high economic returns, in which the formulation and optimal solution algorithm are the main issues of study. Petri-nets have proven to be a promising technique to solve many difficult problems associated with the modeling, formal analysis, design and coordination control of discrete event systems. One of the major advantages of using a Petri-net model is that the same model can be used for the analysis of behavioral properties and performance evaluation, as well as for the systematic construction of discrete event simulators and controllers. This paper aims to present a Petri-net based approach for the scheduling of operations in batch plants. Firstly, the short-term scheduling of batch plants is formulated using timed Petri-net. Secondly, the heuristic search algorithm for scheduling of batch plants is given, which is based on generating and checking the markings in the reachability tree of the Petri-net model. Finally, the novel formulation and algorithm are tested using two simulation case studies, and compared against traditional methods.},

@article{Hegyhati2009,
abstract = {Multipurpose batch processes entail various operational policies that have been widely investigated in published literature. In this paper, no-intermediate-storage (NIS), zero-wait (ZW) and common-intermediate-storage (CIS) operational policies are of particular interest. In all these policies, no dedicated storage facility is available between two consecutive units. Unlike the other operational policies, these particular policies bear some subtle practical infeasibility that has gone unnoticed in literature. In essence, this infeasibility has been reported as optimal, thus assumed to be feasible, by various authors using mathematical programming techniques. It pertains to a unit transferring product to one or more units whilst simultaneously receiving feed from another, which is practically infeasible and as such need not be considered as a possible solution. This feature is particularly conspicuous in batch processes with complex recipes wherein production paths can be in opposite directions. This paper presents the unique feature of the S-graph framework to isolate cross-transfer during optimization, whereas the available mathematical programming methods inherently fail neither to detect nor to eliminate this infeasibility. A few examples taken from published literature are presented for demonstration purposes.},

abstract = {The S-graph framework introduced by Sanmarti et al. (1998), originally developed for
single processor, is proved to be an effective tool for batch process scheduling. The
basic algorithm of the framework follows branch-and-bound strategy that provides an
opportunity for parallelization. Nowadays, multi-core processors are available even in
personal computers, thus, parallel algorithms become more important and useful in
practice.
Two types of parallel scheduling algorithms are introduced here. In the first one, each
processor considers the entire search space, while in the second one, some processors
perform a look-ahead strategy for sharpening the bound.
The proposed algorithms are effective in practice, for some examples the so called
super-linearity occurs, i.e., for n processor system, the running time can be less than the
n-th fraction of the time required by a single processor.},
